# Getting to Know the Editor

The plugin provides a powerful in-game GUI editor, allowing you to freely translate all the content of the editor. This means **YuIllustration** doesn't require kernel translation like **MMOItems**; instead, you can directly modify the language files to translate.  
Even within the same server, at the same time, two people using different languages can see the editor in different languages (the encyclopedia GUI displayed to players does not have this feature).

## Features

All contents regarding encyclopedia **categories** and **entries** can be operated within the editor:  

- Category icons
- Entry icons
- Entry rewards
- Entry unlock conditions

The relationship between **categories** and **entries** will be discussed in the next section.
